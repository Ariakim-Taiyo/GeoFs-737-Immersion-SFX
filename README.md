**Ground effect sounds**; *When you get close to the ground, you will hear a whooshing sound as the air resonates under the plane*<br>
**Dynamic Touchdown sounds**; *Ryanair pilots better prepare their ears, because hard landings wont sound quite the same as soft ones.*<br>

**Passengers Clapping**; *If you make an acceptable landing when in bad weather, the passengers will clap for you!*<br>
**Passengers Screaming**; *Suggested by user BlooketHackerX, If you go into a nosedive or put the plane in a perilous situation, the passengers will react accordingly.*<br>
**Flaps Lever Clicking**; *When you adjust the flaps, the lever makes a distinctive click sound*<br>
**Trim Wheel Noise**; *The trim wheel makes a sound when you adjust the trim*<br>
**Flaps Extending/Retracting Sound**; *The flaps make a faint whirr when moved.*<br>
