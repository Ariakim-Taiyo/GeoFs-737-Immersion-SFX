Release Version 1.4<br>


*September 2nd update: fixed 3.3 compatibility, rewrote wing spring simulation, new sound set (no more sound clipping issues.)*

Adds 48 new high quality sounds to the 737-700. Every default sound has been completely rewritten!<br>


**Current Features:**<br>


**Authentic Engine Recordings**; *The famous 737 "buzzsaw" sound is now modelled in GeoFs!*<br>
**Directional Audio**; *The soundset changes depending on the location of the camera and distance. Watch out for the backblast!*<br>
**Cabin Sounds and Ambience**; *Hear the electronics and passengers when you switch to a cabin view. Engine sounds are muffled as well.* <br>
**Reverse Thrust Loudness**; *The reverse thrust now has its own sound!*<br>
**Alarms, GPWS, and TCAS**; *Radioaltimiter callouts and alarms from 777 overhaul, TCAS modified from the airbus counterpart.* <br>
**Better Rolling Sounds**; *The default rolling sound has been replaced with a better one.*<br>
**Gear retraction sounds**; *The Iconic 737 gear retraction whirr is in the game now!*<br>
**Ground effect sounds**; *When you get close to the ground, you will hear a whooshing sound as the air resonates under the plane*<br>
**Dynamic Touchdown sounds**; *Ryanair pilots better prepare their ears, because hard landings wont sound quite the same as soft ones.*<br>
**Stall Shaking/Buffeting**; *A camera effect that shakes the camera in the cockpit when you are at high aoa.*<br>
**Rain Sounds**; *Hear the rain dynamically respond to parameters such as speed and precipitation rate!*<br>
**Passengers Clapping**; *If you make an acceptable landing when in bad weather, the passengers will clap for you!*<br>
**Passengers Screaming**; *Suggested by user BlooketHackerX, If you go into a nosedive or put the plane in a perilous situation, the passengers will react accordingly.*<br>
**Flaps Lever Clicking**; *When you adjust the flaps, the lever makes a distinctive click sound*<br>
**Trim Wheel Noise**; *The trim wheel makes a sound when you adjust the trim*<br>
**Flaps Extending/Retracting Sound**; *The flaps make a faint whirr when moved.*<br>
**Dynamic Wingflex**; *The wingflex has been completely rewritten to add ground bounce when you go over a bump, and accurate inertial physics to make them actually boing.*<br>
